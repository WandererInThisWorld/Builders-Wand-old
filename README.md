# Builders Wand
A Datapack for Minecraft Java Edition 1.13 that brings parts of the "Better Builder's Wand" into Vanilla Minecraft

As the Name suggests, this Datapack adds a Wand into the game that lets you place Blocks down faster than just one at a Time. When the player holds the Wand in the Main Hand it projects a Marker onto any surface the player is looking at. 

When the player is first using it, no particles will show. That is because the Player will have to select the Mode first. 

The Select the Mode, which dictates the way are being placed, switch the Item from your Main Hand into your Offhand. Then a Chat Message appears where you get three options: [North-South (X)]  [East-West (Z)] and [Up-Down (Y)]. Click either one of those and Particles will show an outline of Blocks where Blocks can be placed. The Marker shows particles around itself, roughly the size of a Block, and depending on the Mode, outlines into the +/- x-Direction, +/- z-Direction and +/- y-Direction.

In order for you to place Blocks with the Wand, you need to Place a Line of Blocks that you would like to expand. Then place your Marker on that Line and rightclick. To place Blocks you will need to have the appropriate Blocks in your Inventory. If you run out of Blocks, you can't place them anymore, logically.

The Marker shows particles around itself, roughly the size of a Block, and depending on the Mode, outlines into the +/- x-Direction, +/- z-Direction and +/- y-Direction.
